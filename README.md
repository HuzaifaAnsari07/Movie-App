## 💡 Key Learnings

While building this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- **JSX & Components** – Creating reusable and structured UI components.  
- **React Hooks (useEffect)** – Managing side effects like fetching data.  
- **API Integration** – Fetching real-time movie data using API keys.  
- **React Router** – Implementing page routing for seamless navigation.  
- **Context API** – Managing global state across components efficiently.  
- **Mapping & Conditional Rendering** – Dynamically displaying content.  
- **UI/UX Best Practices** – Designing a visually appealing and responsive interface.  
- **Debugging & Problem Solving** – Learning from errors and optimizing the code.  

This project reflects not just the app, but a journey of **hands-on learning, persistence, and practical application** of React concepts.
